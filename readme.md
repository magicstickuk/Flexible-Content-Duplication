Copy any 'section' of your pages ACF's flexible content field from one page to another.

To do a duplication hover over the layout handle of a layout (in the same location you would expand or collapse a layout) and click on the Duplicate Layout icon.

== NOTES ==

*   Requires ACF PRO >= 5.7. As it uses some of the new Javascript API
*   Credit to Remodal plugin for modal functionality http://vodkabears.github.io/remodal/

== TODO ==

*   Allow user to pick SPECIFIC index position in destination post, rather than just start or end.
*   Add control for duplicating all layouts in a page at once
*   Include Post status in the Select2 dropdown to provide better feedback to user what page they are selecting
*   Use a WordPress core lightbox instead of a pre-packaged one to reduce footprint


== Installation ==

1. Upload `acf-flexible-content-dup` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
